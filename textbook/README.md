#About this textbook

This textbook is structured so that each chapter in this text corresponds to a homework assignment, covering roughly about two weeks' time each. 

Present in each chapter is a homework assignment and at least one lab. 
In some chapters, additional material will be organized into sections.
Each section in a chapter covers a topic that will be useful in understanding and completing the assignments.
The number of sections in each chapter will vary according to amount of new material that must be introduced for that chapter's homework assignment; some chapters may not even have additional sections at all!


Some chapters will also have a FAQ section answering some of the most common
questions about each homework.

##Labs
Every week, there will be a lab assignment to complete in your enrolled lab section.
Each lab is worth 10 points towards your final grade.
If you complete the work during lab, you will get full credit.
If you do not finish during lab, you can show it to your TA during office hours for 8/10 points.
If you show up to lab late, you will get -5 points.

Labs 0 and 1 are to be completed individually.
Every other lab is to be completed using [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming).
That means you MUST work with a partner;
if you work alone, you will get a 0 on the lab.
If there is an odd number of people in lab, there should be ONE group of three.
You are not allowed to work with the same partner twice;
every week you should be working with someone different.


##Homework Assignments
Every two weeks, there will be a homework assignment due, for a total of five assignments. 
It would be wise to start assignments as soon as possible, or at the very least start planning your approach.
Most assignments offer extra credit for completing a bonus task, which can range in difficulty and point value. 
Assignments are "turned in" by pushing your repository onto github by midnight of the due date.  
If you have a question that isn't answered in the text or in the FAQ section, post an issue onto github.
