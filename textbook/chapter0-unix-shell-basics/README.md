#Chapter 0: Unix Shell Basics

This chapter covers the basic concepts and tools you will need in order to understand how to write a simple command line shell.  

##Section 0 : system calls
This section contains files which cover three basic system calls that will be used in the homework assignment, as well as an error-checking function. 
 
* [README.md](./section0-system-calls/README.md) - this file covers `perror`, an error-checking function for your system calls (a requirement throughout the course), as well as an overview of syscalls.

* [exec.md](./section0-system-calls/exec.md) -  
This file covers the following syscalls:

	* `fork` - creates copies of the parent process, or "child" processes, necessary to execute commands from the command line.

	* `wait` - allows program to wait for child processes to finish executing before continuing.

	* `exec` -  executes executables. 

##Section 1 : parsing
This section covers a couple of parsing tools that may be useful for your homework assignment

*  [strtok](./section1-parsing/strtok) - 
this folder covers the C library function ```strtok``` to tokenize, or break apart, a c-string.

*  [Boost Tokenizer](./section1-parsing/BoostTokenizer) - 
this folder covers this Boost library class that tokenizes strings, examples included.

##Section 2 : Makefile
This section covers how to write Makefiles.

* [Makefile](./section2-make/Makefile) - 
this file houses an example Makefile.

* [make](./section2-make/make) - 
this folder contains a tutorial on using ```make``` to compile and install programs easily with Makefiles, as well as numerous examples.

##lab0 - [vim](./lab0-vim)

Introduces Vim, the text editor of choice for the class, and how to navigate it. Learn how to configure your .vimrc file to your liking. 

##lab1 - [git](./lab1-git)

Practice with using git for version control, creating and forking repositories to your local machine, updating repositories, and sharing them through github.

##hw0 - [rshell](./hw0-rshell)

Write your own basic Unix shell to execute simple commands with parameters, and to handle connectors.
