##rshell

Am I modifying rshell for this assignment  
[Yes.](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/ucr-cs100/issues/427)
Unlike `ls`, which is a stand-alone program that a shell executes, piping and input/output redirection must be built into the shell. 

##i/o redirection

Should the program be able to handle connectors and i/o redirection in the same line?  
[No, you don't have to implement this.](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/ucr-cs100/issues/433)

Should the program be able to handle multiple/combined i/o redirections?  
[Yes. However, it is up to you to decide how to handle multiples of the same redirections.](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/ucr-cs100/issues/446)


##wait

How many times should I wait for children?
