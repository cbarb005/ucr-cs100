#Chapter 3: Signals
This brief chapter principally covers signals and how to handle them. Note there are no additional sections;
at this point in the course, you are expected to know how to use the man pages and previously learned material to figure out how to complete the labs and homeworks.

##lab6 - [signal](./lab6-signal)

 Learn how to use `sigaction` to control the way signals are handled by a program.

##lab7- [cstring](./lab7-cstring)

In this lab, you will implement a number of c-string functions, including `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `strlen` among others.

##HW3 - [signals](./hw3-signals)

Build the `cd` command into your rshell program, and modify rshell to catch and handle the `^C` signal.
